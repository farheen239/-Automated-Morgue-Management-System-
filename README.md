This project monitors individual morgue chambers using sensors like DHT11 (temperature/humidity) and MQ gas sensors. The Arduino collects real-time environmental data and sends it to a Python AI model. The AI analyzes the data and predicts the condition inside each morgue unit, giving clear status messages like “Stable,” “Warning,” or “Critical Decomposition.” This system helps maintain proper storage conditions and alerts staff before problems occur
